# COSC 307: Honors Data Structures and Algorithms II

This is my personal repository for storing my solutions to homework and labs for COSC 302 at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. This repository is **not** to be used for getting answers to assignments for this course. However, you're more than welcome to use supplimentary material, such as shell scripts for testing code or input files for labs, that can be found in this repository.

## Labs

My solutions to the labs. Each lab has its own directory. Each directory contains my C++(98) code and executable for the lab, any provided material for the lab, a README describing the lab, and the original HTML file describing the lab. Each directory also has a `solutions` sudirectory which contains the provided solution executable, my executable, a shell script for testing, and any other files required to test my code.

## Homework

To be added at a later time.
