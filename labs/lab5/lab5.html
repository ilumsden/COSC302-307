<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 5 (150+50 pts: Spring, 2018)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
You have worked hard all semester. Now it's time to play. In this lab
you will write a program for generating a maze, another program for
solving it, and an optional
third program for displaying your maze and its solution.
You will be using many of the C++/STL skills you have learned in 
conjunction with data structures and algorithms such as
disjoint-set and depth-first graph search.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Submit your work via Canvas no later than
9:59am Monday April 2, 2018.
You submit a tar file that contains missing Support.h 
Support.cpp files which provide the functionality
needed.
CS307 students must also include a Mazeshow.cpp source code file
for visualizing a maze and the path through it.
CS302 students once again have the opportunity to earn extra credits
by doing this part of the assignment.

<h3>Getting started and what you need to do</h3>

See Wikipedia for a general description of how to 
generate and solve mazes: 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm"
TARGET="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm</a>
We will proceed with a simple version that generates mazes which have lots
of the usual deadends. Perhaps somewhat unusual, they allow any cell to 
be reached from any other cell. This would easy to fix but besides the
point of the exercise.
<p>

To help you get started, run the Hydra script
/home/cs302/labs/lab5/copy to obtain the following files:
game.sh (shell script for taking the fun out of generating and 
solving mazes),
mazemake, mazesolve and mazeshow (Hydra solution executables),
Mazemake.cpp and Mazesolve.cpp (driver program source codes),
and a makefile.
Your job is to write the support code needed to create your own
Mazemake and Mazesolve executables which must behave as described next.
Mazeshow is a standalone program that you write entirely on your own.
<p>

<LI>
<b>Mazemake (75 pts)</b><br>
Mazemake generates a random maze. The program takes two 
commandline arguments, namely,
Nrows and Ncols. Your first job is to write the missing
code for this program. Define a maze class and place it
in a file called Support.h. Place member function
implementations in a file called Support.cpp. See the
provided Mazemake.cpp file for public members needed.
Your code must be compatible with this main program
which you must not change.
<p>

Conceptually, 
imagine an Nrows x Ncols grid where the grid lines have been 
colored in. Now randomly erase grid lines between neighboring 
cells until paths exist that will allow you to walk from any cell 
to any other cell. That's the maze you will make. You will 
treat this maze grid as a graph.
How you create the graph is up to you, but keep the following observations
in mind. Cell (i,j) has four neithbors, namely, (i-1,j), (i,j-1), (i+1,j),
and (i,j+1). The connectivity is bidirectional. That is, if (i-1,j; i,j) 
represents a wall, then (i,j; i-1;j) represents the same wall viewed
in the opposite direction. Same goes when no wall is present.
Cells on the periphery do not have neighbors outside the grid. The
easiest way to handle them is to never remove the outer walls thereby
making it impossible to step off the grid.
<p>

Technically speaking, a graph consists of vertices and edges. 
However, you don't need
to store the maze graph vertices since they are merely
(i,j) index pairs which you can traverse using nested loops.
You also don't need to store the edges since they are
given by the grid. What you do need to store are Boolean variables that 
indicate whether a neighbor is walled off or not. To keep us all on the
same page, let neighbor index 0 refer to cell (i-1,j), while neighbor
indices 1, 2, and 3 refer to cells (i,j-1), (i+1,j), and (i,j+1),
respectively. Let each of the corresponding four Booleans variables be
true is there is a wall between (i,j) and the cell in question, 
and false is there isn't a wall.
This means you can represent the graph as a 2D array which has
Nrows x Ncols rows and four columns. You look up cell (i,j)
using index i*Ncols+j. This is no different from the matrix class
where we stored the data in a 1D buffer and allowed 2D lookup. 
<p>

Initially, set all cells to be completely walled in (all four 
Boolean variable are true). In order to efficiently select which
walls to remove (which Booleans variables to set false), generate
a list of all <i>interior neighbor cell pairs</i>
which you then subject to random perturbation (see
similarly named code handout from Feb 10, 2018). Having done
that, you merely have to iterate thru this list while using a 
disjoint-set (see similarly named code handout from Mar 11, 2018) 
to see if a wall should be removed. How so?
First, place each cell in its own set. When given a neighbor
cell pair, remove the wall between them if the two cells belong to
different sets and merge the cells into the same set. When
all cells end up belonging to the same set, stop the process
since all cells are now connected to each other. 
<p>

The last step is to output the maze to stdout for redirection into 
a file. The output format should be as indicated below. 
Basically, you state where to put a wall by providing integers
that refer to a cell and a wall. 
Once again, the cell at grid position (i,j) is represented by
the integer i*Ncols+j and the four neighbors 
(i-1,j), (i,j-1), (i+1,j), and (i,j+1) are indicated by
0, 1, 2, and 3. 
<p>

Hint: Keep in mind that if you break down the wall between 
cell i and cell j and indicate this in cell i's wall list, 
you must also update cell j's wall list to indicate the 
lack of a wall between it and cell i. If you forget to
this, then you end up with one-way walls which make no
sense.
<p>

<LI> 
<b>Mazesolve (75 pts)</b><br>
Mazesolve finds a path thru the maze. 
The program reads a maze file from stdin and outputs the
path to stdout.
Your job is to add functionality to the maze class.
Update the maze class in Support.h. Add new member function
implementations in Support.cpp. See the
provided Mazemake.cpp file for public members needed.
Your code must be compatible with this main program
which you must not change.
<p>

Read the maze file and re-create the graph that represents it
by doing the opposite of what you did in the mazemake program. 
Hint: Mazemake initialized the maze to have walls between every 
cell and then proceeded to knock them down. Mazesolve should
initialize the maze to not have no walls and use the maze file 
to add them. 
<p>

Once the graph is in place, apply depth-first search to find 
a path thru the maze (stack based backtracking). Assume
the source is index 0 and the sink is index Nrows x Ncols - 1.
Keep in mind that you don't want to enter into cycles. That is,
you don't want to revisit cells already visited. Use vertex 
coloring for this purpose. Also, you can't walk thru walls.
Finally, you need to leave a ``breadcrumb trail'' as you go 
along, so you can find your way back. That is, make a note of 
who the predecessor is when you move from one cell to the next.
<p>

The last step is to output the path to stdout for redirection into 
a file.  The output format should be as indicated below. This time,
you output the sequence of cells on the path. 
<p>

<LI>
<b>Mazeshow (50 pts): Required for CS307, optional for CS302</b>
<br>
Mazeshow creates either a ppm image of the maze or
a ppm image of the maze or with the solution overlaid in yellow
(think "Wizard of Oz").
The program takes commandline arguments arguments accordingly:
a maze file for the former version and
a maze file and a path for the latter version.
Make this a standalone program that doesn't depend on the
Support.h and Support.cpp files. See inspiration from
code handouts and previous labs wrt ppm file manipulation.
<p>

There is not much to say about this program. Create an
(Nrows x width + 1) x (Ncols x width + 1) sized ppm image
where width is the number of pixels assigned to a cell.
Make width a variable but set it to 11 for the code you
submit.
Walls should be drawn in the top row or left column of a cell.
Since
wall index 0 for (i,j) is wall index 2 for (i-1,j) you really
only need to color the former, but there is nothing
wrong in coloring both walls and doing that makes for less
checking.
Likewise,
wall index 1 for (i,j) is wall index 3 for (i,j-1) you really
only need to color the former, there is nothing
wrong in coloring both walls and doing that makes for less
checking. Same problem and solution, same wording.
<p>

This probably sounds confusing, but it's actually pretty
straightforward.
At first, make the ppm image white (255,255,255). 
Then add the walls which you color black (0,0,0). 
The only tricky bit is stepping
thru the width x width blocks for each maze grid cell.
The bottom and right hand side walls are the single
pixel add-ons indicated by the image size 
(* + 1) x (* + 1) above.
When a path file is also given, first color the maze grid
cells yellow (240,240,100). 
The add the black maze grid. The reason
for doing the path first is that it's easier to color the
entire cell than to work out which pixels are walls.
<p>

When done, write the resulting ppm to stdout and redirect
it into a file. Then take a look!
Word of warning: A 100 x 100 maze contains 10,000 cells. 
Using 11 x 11 pixels to represent each cell, the
size of the ppm image is 3 x 10,000 x 121 = 3.5 Mbytes. 
Consider piping the output from mazeshow to 
"convert - filename.png"
to get a smaller file which is faster to download via
a wireless network. See the game.sh shell script.
