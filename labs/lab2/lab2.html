<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 2 (75 pts: Spring, 2018)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
In this lab you will continue sorting the multi-column
data from Lab 1 which consisted of
a firstname, a lastname, and a phone number.
The difference is that data will
now be stored in single linked list.
In order to allow sorting by means of the std::sort algorithm 
(or any of the array based sort algoriths developed in class),
you will embed the smart pointer concept within the single linked 
list class and write the associated code for setting things up
and applying the result.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Submit your work via Canvas no later than
9:59am Monday February 12, 2018.
You only submit the Sort_sptr.cpp file. The incremental
development outlined below is merely intended to make
solving the problem more manageable.
<p>

<hr>

<h3>Getting started and what you need to do</h3>

To help you get started,
run the Hydra script
/home/cs302/labs/lab2/copy to obtain the following files: 
Sort_sptr.cpp (skeleton code), sort_sptr (Hydra solution
executable), and a makefile. 
Your job is to write the missing source code which must
behave as described next.
Use the data files from Lab 1.
<p>

Develop your code incrementally.
Sort_sptr.cpp must always contain ALL code needed to 
satisfy this lab. 
You will work with multi-file assignments in later labs.
<p>

<UL>

<LI>
Get a copy of the Quicksort.cpp file you submitted
for Lab 1.
Update Sort_sptr.cpp to include the definition of 
class person_t including
the associated input and output operators.
Also copy and add the no-argument command-line check
as well as the template based printlist function.
Write the missing slist::node::constructor that
takes a data argument; 
this functionality is needed by slist::push_back() 
when it creates a new node.
Include header files and
do whatever else it takes for the code to compile 
(shouldn't be much), then test and make sure you can 
read and write data from the lists provided.
<p>

<LI>
Add an overloaded less-than comparison operator
to the node subclass.
Embed the smart pointer code as a private slist subclass; 
copy the code verbatim from the smartpointer_handout,
then modify it to explicitly work for slist::node data.
<p>

Update the slist::sort() function to sort the 
single linked list data using the std::sort() function.
Determine the number of elements stored in the list.
Allocate a vector of smart pointers of that size
called Ap.
Initialize the individual smart pointers 
to point to the list nodes. 
For example, if p = head, then Ap[0] = p-&gt;next, etc.
Apply std::sort
and use the sorted Ap vector to relink the list nodes.
Do not simply repeat the array based
rearrangement covered in class which used pointers
to the data itself. Here, the smart pointers point
to nodes that hold the data.
Also, keep in mind that operator[] is not available. 
You will need to use list node pointers.
When the sorting is done, step through the smart 
pointer vector while creating the linked list. 
For example, if p = head, then p-&gt;next = Ap[0], etc.
Simple as that (once you figure it out). You may
want to draw a picture of what's going on to
help visualize the process.

<h3>Grading rubric</h3>

Note1: Output format of your program must MATCH 
that of the solution executable.
Use the diff command to compare.
<br> 
Note2: If your program does not compile, 
it will likely not be graded and instead assigned a default score of 0.

<h4> Sort_list (75)</h4>
<pre>
10: Base code for reading and writing listX.txt files and storing data in an slist.
15: Embedded smart pointer subclass with explicit application to slist::node data. 
50: Function slist::sort which creates smart pointer array, sorts it using std::sort,
    and applies results to relink slist nodes in sorted order.
