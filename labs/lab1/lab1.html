<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 1 (150 pts: Spring, 2018)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
Welcome to your first CS302 lab which consists of two parts that
both focus on sorting. 
In Part A,
you implement a variant of the quicksort algorithm 
described in class and use it to sort multi-column data consisting of
a firstname, a lastname, and a phone number 
(all made up, but you knew that). 
In Part B,
you make the program take optional commandline arguments that cause
it to sort elements in a given range. 
This extension will be based on a modified version 
of the quickselect algorithm.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Your friendly TAs will tell you how to submit your work to Canvas.
Do not email your code to the instructor or the TAs as they cannot 
upload the code to Canvas for you.
<p>

Part A is due 9:59am Monday January 29, 2018.
Part B is due 9:59am Monday February 5, 2018.
You only submit one file each time. The incremental
development outlined below is merely intended to make
solving the problem more manageable. 
<p>

Part A will only be graded in a cursory manner. 
The code must compile and produce the correct output. 
A quick look will determine if the proper algorithm is applied. 
You will not receive feedback if there is a problem. 
The point is merely to ensure that you are making progress.
Part B will be graded using the rubric listed below. 
This includes all the Part A code and functionality. 
If you aren't confident Part A is written correctly,
see a TA in lab or during their office hours.

<h3>Getting started and what you need to do</h3>

To help you get started,
run the Hydra script
/home/cs302/labs/lab1/copy to obtain the following files:
Quicksort.cpp (skeleton code), quicksort (Hydra solution
executable), list1.txt-list3.txt (data files),
and a makefile.
Your job is to write the missing source code which must
behave as described next.
<p>

Develop your code in stages as described next.
Quicksort.cpp must contain ALL code needed to
first satisfy Part A.
You then update it to also satisfy Part B.
You will work with multi-file assignments in later labs.
<p>

<UL>

<LI>
Part A Vers. 1: Use your favorite editor to modify Quicksort.cpp 
as follows. Update the quicksort() function to accept the arguments
indicated in the main() function, namely, a vector reference and
two integers. Leave the function body empty. For now, quicksort()
is merely a stub. Focus instead on adding the code for the input 
and output operators associated with the person_t class 
which has three private
data members: firstname, lastname, and phonenumber. 
The input operator simply reads each of these every time it is
called.
The output operator prints each person_t object using 
the format: lastname firstname phonenumber. 
See examples below. Part of the assignment is for to figure out
how to maintain a fixed width if the name field so that all
phonenumbers are left justified to the same column position.
Finally, add the printlist() function from the arraylist_handout
modified to print to stdout instead of a named file, and do
whatever else is needed to make the program compile such as
adding missing header files. Then test and make sure it
reads and writes the person_t data as required.
<p>

<LI>
Part A Vers. 2: Add an overloaded operator&lt; for the person_t class 
so you can impose an order on such objects. Test that it works by
having the main() function use std::sort before writing the list
content to stdout. When you are satisfied that this works,
replace std::sort with a modified quicksort algorithm.
That is, instead of the median-of-three partition algorithm you
saw in class and used in HW2, 
randomly pick an index in the left-to-right
range and use it to partition the data.
This new version forces you to think about how the median-of-three
code works as it must explicitly check and prevent going out-bounds 
during the search for data pairs to swap. 
To make you think even more about the
algorithm, merge all the functionality into the quicksort()
function. That is, do not have an external function that carries
out the partitioning. Keep it all in one function that gets called
from the main() function.
Test and compare the output with what you obtained using std::sort. 
The two output should be identical since they use the same comparison
operator.
<p>

This completes Part A. Submit Quicksort.cpp on Canvas after you have
cleaned it up and added a few comments.
<p>

<LI>
Part B Vers. 1: In preparation for the quickselect based sublist
sorting, add command-line argument checks and processing. 
The basic version takes no arguments and executes the code from Part 
A. However, if two integers are provided, they specify the range of 
the array to be sorted, say k1 to k2. You must check that the program is being
executed in one of these two modes. For the second mode, you must
convert the two command-line arguments into integers. Hint: the
atoi() function from the C standard library (cstdlib) can do the job.
<p>

<LI>
Part B Vers. 2: Copy the quickselect() function from the sorting3
handout. Embed the random pivot based partition code that you
added to quicksort() in Part A. The function will take four
arguments, e.g. quickselect(A, left, k, right) where A is a data
array, left and right designate the first and the last indices
to consider (the range), and k the element that needs to be
selected (found and put in its proper place).
Make whatever other modifications
are needed to get the code to compile. 
Test the program to make sure you the selection is correct.
<p>

<p>
Use quickselect(A, 0, k0, N-1) to put the k0-th element in its
proper location and partition the data in A accordingly;

Then
use quickselect(A, k0, k1, N-1) to put the k1-th element in its
proper location and partition the data in A accordingly. Note
that data indexed below k0 is ignored at this point. When this
works, use the quicksort() function to sort the data in the 
k0-k1 range.
<p>

This completes Part B. Submit Quicksort.cpp on Canvas after you have
cleaned it up and added a few comments.

The line numbers added to right for the last output are for illustrational purposes 
and not produced by the program. They help you see that the data in lines 3-6 is sorted
(by design), that the data lines 1-2 is not, and that the data in lines 0, 7-10 is 
(by chance).

<h3>Grading rubric</h3>

Note1: Output format of your program must MATCH
that of the solution executable. Use diff command to compare.
<br>
Note2: If your program does not compile,
it will likely not be graded and instead assigned a default score of 0.

<h4> Quicksort Part A (25)</h4>
<pre>
25: Base code compiles and produces the correct output when executed.
</pre>

You cannot reclaim lost points from Part A but can fix your code
and get full points for functionality and implemention in Part B.

<h4> Quicksort Part B (125) </h4>
<pre>
20: person_t: operator>> and operator<< 
10: person_t: operator< 
20: quicksort: random pivot, while-loop safety guard(s)
20: quicksort: integrated partitioning
20: quickselect: random pivot, integrated partitioning, while-loop safety guard(s)
10: Command-line argument processing: optional k1, k2 pair extraction and use
15: Output matches solution code output exactly
10: Goldielocks comments: not too many, not too few -- just the right amount
