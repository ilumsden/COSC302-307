# Homework 3:

## Problem 1:

Apply mergesort	to the sequence	`A = {6, 4, 3, 9, 4, 7, 5}`. Show your work as done in class. That is, write sequence `A` in its entirety. Indicate what constitutes the left and right subsequences placing	rectangles around them.	On the next many lines, repeat the process first for the left subsequence, then for the right	subsequence. When merging the subsequences as you back out of the recursion, place a rectangle around the larger sublist.
