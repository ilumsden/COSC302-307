# Homework 1:

## Problem 1:

Apply insertion sort to `A = { 3, 9, 7, 4, 1, 8, 3 }`. Show your work as done in class. Write sequence `A` in its entirety. Below it, write the sublist of `A` considered during the first iteration. Circle the element being inserted and add an arrow indicating where it goes if moved. Make the arrow point back to the circled element if it doesnâ€™t move. Update `A` and repeat for the next (longer) sublist. Continue until done.
